# Freelance DevOps

*Cloud oriented DevOps / Linux engineer.*

My peers know me as the 'Docker guy'.

## Intro
Hi my name is Sander Lentink
and I worked as a DevOps for the past two years at Mijndomein.
Starting from december 2018,
I will be available as a freelance engineer.


## Availability

Until the summer of 2019, available for only three days per week,
the other days I am finishing my
MSc. [Security and Network engineering](https://os3.nl).

## Message to recruiters

For any placement I allow a maximum addition of 20% to my hour rate,
preventing a chain of intermediates.
This thus results in a maximum of 16.67% the end customer pays.

## Vision
Paradigms that make me tick are

+ [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code)
+ Clear separation of state[less|ful], e.g. through (docker) containers
+ Diagrams or documentation, begin with the end in mind
+ Don't create technology but solutions
+ Security by design


### Security
Your company IT security is important to me,
security is not optional.

Ever company has a different history/legacy and attack surface,
but the most import aspect is the company culture.
Employees should be thanked if they report an incident,
punishment leads to deleting logs/evidence and fear or reporting.

Security is not achieved through special measures alone,
but by creating awareness.
For me this results in creating tools such as a
[password generator](https://lent.ink/projects/pwd),
a docker based
[firewall](https://hub.docker.com/r/svlentink/ipfilter) (not using iptables on host)
and
[2FA backup tool](https://github.com/svlentink/dockerfiles/tree/master/svlentink/totp-backup),
not for the purpose of using it,
but to create awareness and show alternative possibilities
to existing challenges.

### Dynamic resource

Being a freelancer `==` being a dynamic resource.
The cloud has changed how we manage our IT infrastructure,
from stateful servers in a datacenter to stateless containers in the cloud.
Freelancers enable you to allocate their resources (time, expertise)
like the cloud does for your infrastructure.
