This contains most of the content found on my server,
which is accessible through http via your favorite browser (e.g. w3m ;).

The obvious has been excluded; pictures, archives etc.

My recent js is formated using this [standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard).

You maybe ask, why put this on github?
Well, why not, it is already for everyone to download from my website.
