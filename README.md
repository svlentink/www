This contains most of the content found on my server,
which is accessible through http(s) via your favorite browser (e.g. w3m ;).

The obvious has been excluded; pictures, archives etc.

My recent js is formated using this [standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard).

You may ask, why put this on github?
Well, why not, it is already for everyone to download from my website.
Github gives us syntax highlighting for a better read.


The nginx config is also included, since most can already be guessed
from my certificates and the nginx version number.
