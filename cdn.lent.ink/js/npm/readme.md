# Webpack bundled npm libs

There are two options,
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/author-libraries/)
and
[browserify](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51023231/npm-browserify-import-and-export-may-appear-only-with-sourcetype-module).

The default way (by webpack) of accessing the modules (global variable),
wasn't my cup of tea,
the current approach is inspired by
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49562978/how-to-use-npm-modules-in-browser-is-possible-to-use-them-even-in-local-pc).
