Make sure you pick a time of the year with enough
[hours of daylight](https://weatherspark.com/compare/y/32397~32567/Comparison-of-the-Average-Weather-in-Porto-and-Santiago-de-Compostela#Figures-Daylight).

If one is significantly stronger than the other,
consider using barefoot shoes to increase difficulty.
