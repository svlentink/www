### &#128652; Bus

Most bus stations do not have a digital board with a real time timetable.

### Month pass

Monthly passes are available at
[Andante Shops](https://www.linhandante.com/en/rede-de-vendas)
of which
[this](geo:41.18399998303627,-8.69149589676562?q=41.18399998303627,-8.69149589676562(Brito+Capelo))
is the closest.

Note that if you buy it at the end of the month,
you still pay full price and only get until the end of that month.


### Estadio do Mar

Fun fact.
On the metro line,
we can step out at Estadio do Mar
and walk to metro Senhora da Hora, which will take 6.5min,
while the metro takes 6min.
Thus in case you have a transfer at Senhora da Hora
(e.g. to the airport) and have a lot of time,
you can also choose to walk a bit.
