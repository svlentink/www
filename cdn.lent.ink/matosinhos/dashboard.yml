            During the lockdown in 2020 I went flying as digital nomad.
            This became harder in 2021 and some major border crossing were closed,
            but small bike / pedestrian crossings remained open.
            This enabled me to use these roads to travel with my motorcycles through
            various countries in the EU (as a digital nomad).
