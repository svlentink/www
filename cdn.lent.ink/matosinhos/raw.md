Using bus to Porto is faster, but irregular
metro stops every 10 minutes on weekdays,
you can take any metro, it'll stop in the center of Porto.
I usually take the tram

Officially 3zones ticket needed from Parque Real to go to Porto, but people have been using 2Z as well and got away with it.
11 tickets (10+1) 2z = 12.50, 11 tickets 3z = 16eu
The blue Andante metro card (0.50eu) for Porto is set to the amount of zones on purchase and cannot be changed later.
