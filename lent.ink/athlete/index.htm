First things first,
I come from a culture in which food needs to be fast,
and usually isn't a social gathering.
When you're reading this from a latin american background,
this is important to keep in mind.

I was raised with the beauty ideal for a man to be something like a gymnist,
<i>"los gordo son felices, los flacos son triste"</i>
does not apply to the western culture I grew up in.

Having said that, lets start my personal story.
