<h2>Diet</h2>

As a small kid I loved food.
Most children are hard to get to the table for diner,
I was different.
During my teenage years,
I had times I consumed a loaf of bread a day (breakfast and lunch).
<br/>
<br/>
I've been a fan of healthy food for years now,
abstaining from excessive grease in the past
(vulnerable skin as a teen)
and drinking a lot of water.
I also stopped cooking pork,
for various health reasons,
which I still eat when it is served at someones place.


<h3>Physique</h3>

My general physique was always fine,
always stayed thin by doing enough physical activities (e.g. commuting by bike).
And the last years I mostly managed to keep my 6pack,
even with sometimes a year without any ab workouts.


<h3>Knee injury</h3>

When training for a marathon,
my knee started hurting badly (Q4 2014).
Until the point that taking a stairs or biking was a challenge.
This kept me from doing cardio and meant I didn't run for a year.
<br/>
<br/>
During that time, I also was able to use public transport
a lot, which meant less biking.
No cardio, occasional muscle workout and a desk job (programmer)
meant I needed to watch what I was eating.

<h3>LCHF and LCHP</h3>

I was reading about the concept LCHF and LCHP,
which would be my solution to my strive of
staying ripped for the coming beach season.
<br/>
A couple of years earlier, during a tour at Batavia Werf lelystad,
The guide told me that the people aboard of a ship
during the 17th century, were only getting food twice a day.
This made me question my 5 times a day, while working a desk job.
Less eating is better four your teeth, more efficient and cheaper.
<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea for me was that most food you consume (bread, pasta, rice, potatoes)
have a
<a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=blood+sugar+carbs+fat+protein+graph&tbm=isch">relative short span</a>
of providing energy,
while fatty foods will give you a longer lasting boost of energy,
less hunger means less eating (when not bored).
<br/>
<br/>
I did this diet for a while (until my new boss told me free lunch was included).
Which allowed me to eat twice a day!
I had 1KG of Greek yogurt (10% fat) as breakfast (1250Kcal),
which was sufficient until diner time (with some fruit in between from time to time).
<br/>
<br/>
This diet, of eating twice a day,
gave me the freedom to eat whatever I wanted,
as much as I wanted, but only twice a day.
<br/>
<br/>
This also means that if you eat rice,
you'll be screaming for food after 3h.
It only works when eating fatty products.


<h3>TL;DR</h3>

In the end I believe a lot of people can get a slim body (1),
eat whatever (2) they want and as much (3) as they want.
For me this was true and I believe this can be for others (dutch),
with just 10 min of exercise a day.


<h3>The catch</h3>

Just with everything that seems/is hard in life,
you first need to really want it..
Here is what I did:

<ul>
  <li>Drink lots of water (&gt;4L), optional with a bit of lemon juice</li>
  <li>Only eat twice a day</li>
  <li>Exercise 10 min a day, 6 days a week (I hardly did this, but had a good starting point)*</li>
  <li>Sleeping at least 6h</li>
</ul>

The exercise for me means core (abs and back) one day,
upper body (arms, shoulders) the other.
Which I do just before going to bed,
so my body can build up muscle during sleep from all those proteins.
<br/>
<br/>
In part above I mentioned "dutch",
since cardio is always important.
We in the Netherlands bike every where,
which enables us to skip leg day and cardio altogether.
If you don't bike, you'll need to walk the dog or whatever
you can do to get you hart rate in the fat burning zone
for half an hour a day.
