turn down your consumption dopamine sources before you can find your passion
Dopamine source (passion); consumption (addiction) vs. creation (passion). List of hobbies, wikipedia


put the tasks that keep popping up in your head on your agenda with high priority,
great hobbies are created through sweat and persistence,
your first music/sports class wasn't something that relaxed you

# unordered notes

who do you want to be in life and what percentage of your life does that occupy


Ideas board, weekly, daily

focus vs. relaxation

"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."
- Aristotle


just like sprint planning in scrum,
review weekly


Splits uitdenken en uitwerken. (design phase)
Verander je aanpak van diep naar breed. Als ik aan een bepaalde taak moet beginnen, vooral de creatieve dingen,
new environment. novelty ffect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_effect?utm_campaign=Werk%20Slim&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter

beat your future self,
work from calendar, not todolist
there will always be more to do, work on timeblocks and give your all in it, dont leave when you are 'done'

noticing
wanting
doing
liking

failure premortem
why do you expect to fail,
tackle them by if else plan

place guitar in middle of room, book on pillow
optimize for starting line, not finish line
we need reward




### raw feedback

postive sentence only healthy food

overview values =>personas => met stats (quantity)
'afwijken van planning' ipv slacking, slacking niet duidelijk



correlate with intelligence


ruminate


### raw notes

- estimated time, if too large, demand to split into tasks, not possible, do research first, plan time for that
- actual spend time (when finsihed)
- create_by (multi user)
- create_on (intresting metric)
- status (stages of scrum backlog)
- responsible (user)
- moscow rating
- Due dates
- categories
- priority
- boolean:passion, denoted by heart, option for other symbols like iron for gym

.

- small actionable projects
- tasks/items; an overview per category (having dedicated time blocks for each)
- one system for all tasks, not email, notes(keep), etc.
- use fixed time blocks, plan items in that time block, you are never done, therefore allocate time per subject
- allow import of multiple yaml files
- PREP / TO DO / DOING / ON HOLD / DONE / CANCELLED


maybe use scrum per area of life?
