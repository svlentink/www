## Disclamer
I'm not a behavior scientist,
but a software developer,
trying to help (autistic) people visualize their life.
This method is not based on any scientific research.

Anyone from social sciences who likes to provide feedback,
feel free to provide improvement suggestions.

## Knowledge
People tend to underestimate the power of knowledge.
For example, starting with running seems pretty straight forward.
However, half an hour on a park bench studying the running techniques
of people passing by will reveil that there is much more to something
even a three year old is able to do.
In everything you do in life,
invest a small percentage of the time spend on it,
to gain more knowledge on it
and things will improve.

## Planning of recurring activities
Mornings are sacred, you'll do your morning routine 9 out of 10 times.
Evening routines are nice to haves,
they can fluctuate.
Plan your Must haves in the morning and your Should and Could haves in the evenings.

+ First make a list of all your activities
+ Label if they give or take from your mental energy
+ Give them a duration (estimated time)
+ Indicate the prefered moment; morning, evening or weekend
+ Start planning your workday morning, first plan the 'providing' mental energy activities (e.g. meditation). Every workday morning should start the same way
+ Plan your weekday evenings, first the mental energy providing activities.
+ Plan your weekends, but only half a day of recurring tasks, per weekend.

First plan you big rocks,
followed by things that give you energy
and end with energy drainers.
Plan cognitive intensive (brainpower) tasks in the morning,
the repetitive tasks later.
