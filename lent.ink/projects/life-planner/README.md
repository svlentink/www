## Disclamer
I'm not a behavior scientist,
but a software developer,
trying to help (autistic) people visualize their life.
This method is not based on any scientific research.

Anyone from social sciences who likes to provide feedback,
feel free to provide improvement suggestions.

## Knowledge
People tend to underestimate the power of knowledge.
For example, starting with running seems pretty straight forward.
However, half an hour on a park bench studying the running techniques
of people passing by will reveil that there is much more to something
even a three year old is able to do.
Investing a portion of everything in your life in gaining more knowledge
on the topic will improve them.

## Planning of recurring activities
Morning are sacred, you'll do your morning routine 9 out of 10 times.
Evening routines are nice to haves,
they can fluctuate.
Plan your Must haves in the morning and your Should and Could haves in the evenings.

+ First make a list of all your activities
+ Label if they give or take from your mental energy
+ Give them a duration (estimated time)
+ Indicate the prefered moment; morning, evening or weekend
+ Start planning your workday morning, first plan the 'providing' mental energy activities (e.g. meditation). Every workday morning should start the same way
+ Plan your weekday evenings, first the mental energy providing activities.
+ Plan your weekends, but only half a day of recurring tasks, per weekend.

First plan you big rocks and the things that give you energy.

turn down your consumption dopamine sources before you can find your passion
Dopamine source (passion); consumption (addiction) vs. creation (passion). List of hobbies, wikipedia


put the tasks that keep popping up in your head on your agenda with high priority,
great hobbies are created through sweat and persistence,
your first music/sports class wasn't something that relaxed you

### raw feedback

postive sentice only healthy food
No_desc is verwarrend
overview values =>personas => met stats (quantity)
'afwijken van planning' ipv slacking, slacking niet duidelijk

real examples, with words such as personas, trigger

correlate with intelligence


Plan cognitive intensive (brainpower) tasks in the morning,
the repetitive tasks later.


Splits uitdenken en uitwerken. (design phase)
Verander je aanpak van diep naar breed. Als ik aan een bepaalde taak moet beginnen, vooral de creatieve dingen,
new environment. novelty ffect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_effect?utm_campaign=Werk%20Slim&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter

beat your future self,
work from calendar, not todolist
