<h2>Voting service</h3>

<b>No cure, no pay</b>
<br/>
<br/>

I offer a strange service; online votes.
I have gained experience with brute forcing polls on website,
but also voting on competitions.

Past examples
<ul>
  <li>Voting competitions (e.g. you can vote for your favorite art group, which needs email verification)</li>
  <li>Giving dating profile higher ranking (brute force 5 stars)</li>
  <li>Manipulation of online polls</li>
  <li>Liking all potential partners</li>
  <li>Ordering junk food for the lowest price (e.g. a bag of ketchup) (never ordered something, just found security hole)</li>
  <li>Looking up friends on protected networks</li>
</ul>

<b>One case explained</b> (since they fixed it).
<br/>
Okcupid gave an error when entering the wrong password,
but the correct email address.
They also returned the user profile id.
This gave me the opportunity to load a user his contacts from gmail,
process the CSV and try all emails.
This gave the user an overview of all his connections their
(usually hidden behind nickname) profiles.
Another big service, Tagged, had even a worse security flaw,
getting the emails from the profiles (more then 5y ago).

<h3>But why?</h3>
I first came across this concept when there was a competition in which you could win a Nissan Leaf,
a brand new car!
The linkedin profile of the guy, having the most votes,
told me he was a senior software engineer.

<h3>How?</h3>
As a security researcher
(sounds better then white hacker, I'm not a cracker!!),
I use curl to set forward IP and usually write a simple chrome extension to click on the links in gmail.

<h3>Service</h3>
I offer my service, example cases are:
<ul>
  <li>Your high school bands wants to win the school through voting.</li>
  <li>You are a man on whatever kind of social media, and want some brute force, since you're socially awkward.</li>
  <li>Your sports club has a online poll, but you really hate the alternatives and just want that one option.</li>
  <li>You care about the well being of your colleagues and want to vote for healthier food.</li>
</ul>
<b>When you should NOT contact me:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Anything political</li>
  <li>Anything religious (i.e. political)</li>
  <li>Things that are beyond innocent</li>
  <li>Cracking, hacking (I add data, not extract)</li>
</ul>

When it's beyond something like a "voting poll for the color of towels in the local gym",
I assume you are the host of the website,
and you just pay me to check if I can manipulate scores,
so I am doing nothing illegal, and just trust you on your word.
This gives you the responsibility.
<br/>
<br/>
To be clear, I do not vote.
You request a custom made tool,
that will do the voting for you, which I will create.
No guarantees, if the site updates, the tool doesn't work anymore, that's your problem.


<h4>Rates</h4>
The following are the standard prices.
<ol>
  <li><a href='http://paypal.me/svlentink/25'>$25</a> Poll manipulation (chrome extension)</li>
  <li><a href='http://paypal.me/svlentink/50'>$50</a> With email verification (chrome extension)</li>
  <li><a href='http://paypal.me/svlentink/100'>$100</a> Run part on server (for changing the forward IP) (docker and chrome extension)</li>
</ol>
If the price gets higher, the problem is to complex,
I will notify. In all cases, No cure, No pay.

What you'll get is usually a small explanation of my findings
(as a web host you want to know this to secure it ;)
and a chrome extension you are suppose to use to accomplish where you asked for,
the brute force adding of votes, data etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact me, send me the details of your goal.
If I don't respond, don't feel offended, I probably was unable to do it and am ashamed to admit,
or your proposal is something I just dislike (old men approaching young girls).
If I respond with code, I trust you to pay me on Paypal!
