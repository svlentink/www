<h2>Is it secure?</h2>
The hash generated gives you 128bit password strenght if you have
a good passphrase.
Since the password is a hash,
it is unique for every website
and when you create an account at a malicious service,
it is not able to login into any of your other accounts.
<br/>
You could have multiple passphrases,
e.g. one for all work related, one for social media and one for remaining accounts.
<br/>
NOTE: some website have a max length on a password,
this means a lower strenght,
especially since the hash part is hexadecimal.
But the requirement of max length already indicates that such a service
has bad security.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
It is inspired by
<a href='https://pwdhash.github.io/website/'>Stanford PwdHash</a>
and works by doing
<br/>
<code>echo -n 'apex.tldPASSPHRASE' | shasum</code>
<br/>
It is a concatenation of the domain you want a password for,
together with a phrase that you use.
This string is then used to calculate a hash,
which is your password.
To allow for specific password requirements,
we prefix the hash with a capital letter and a special character
(we picked '!' since it is the first in the
<a href='https://www.asciitable.com'>ASCII table</a>).
We picked 'R' since it is the 18th letter of the alphabet
and we changed the password of this website in 2018.
