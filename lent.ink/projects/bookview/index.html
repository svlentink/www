<h1>Bookviewer</h1>

During college, you need to read books for exams.
Sometimes a very expensive book has only one or two chapters you need to know.
<br/>
Usually some student somewhere scans the pages and shares them.
<br/>
In the past, people shared a folder with images (scanned pages),
nowadays it's mostly PDF.
<br/>
This tool was build before that age.
<br/>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href='browse/'>Browse</a>
    </td>
    <td>
      Go through pages
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href='list/'>list</a>
    </td>
    <td>
      Compose list of chapters
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This tool depends on a CDN which hosts the pictures.
Usually this content is copy write protected.
<br/>
Therefor we have the metadata of the book separate.
<pre><code>
{
  "pagesUrl": "http://shady.server.com/mybook/",
  "index":{
    "chapterid": ["title","alternative-title"]
  },
  "chapters":{
    "chapterid": {
      "start": 42, #number of starting page
      "end": 45
    }
  },
  "pages":{
    "42": {
      "firstChapterOnPage" : "chapterid", #optional
      "file": "042_mybook.jpg"
    }
  }
}  
</code></pre>

You supply your .json with this info as a hash parameter to the tools.
