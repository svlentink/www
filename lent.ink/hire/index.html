Just received my BSc (nov 2016).
<br/>
My graduation thesis began at Blendle; I researched the opportunities for network layer caching.
This research concluded that the intended caching (on the network layer) was not feasible,
which made me implement a new docker based architecture with a custom CI at Superbuddy.
<br/>
The back-end / DevOps is what interests me most.
My passion is to create awesome back-end solutions,
on the application layer and the virtualization (e.g. docker) layer.
This makes creating visual appealing interfaces (CSS) not my thing.
<br/>
I value security and code/architecture quality.
Being allowed to spend the 10% overhead on creating a diagram and considering security.
