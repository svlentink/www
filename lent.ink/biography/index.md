## Early childhood

My parents loved to travel with their caravan behind the car.
Usually to France, where I would be in the
[swimming](https://github.com/svlentink/resume/blob/master/content/education/other/1998_swim-a.yml) pool each day.
When a teenager one trip per year would be to the snow, where my brother and I snowboarded and my sister and dad went ski-ing, while mom read books.

Grew up in a suburb with two working parents, mom at the court and dad at chamber of commerce, both vocationally trained.
We had a Portuguese nanny.


Energetic kid, biking around NL.
To vocational school by bike 27km to and 27km back on a Gazelle Kathmandu, this was the era before electric bikes.

Wild camping, I told my parents I was staying at Jeroen, he told his parents he stayed at me, and yes we stayed with each other while illegally wild camping in nature.

My mom had a life long interest in health and food, for my dad it was being a workaholic when I was young and later transitioned to be more focused on his Christian faith.
