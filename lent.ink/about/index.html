Hi, my name is Sander Lentink and I live in
<a href='https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Netherlands'>the Netherlands</a> (Amsterdam).
As a data analyst and
<i style="text-decoration:line-through;">hacker</i>
IT security researcher,
I created a slightly different website.

Most content here is geeky,
but I've made effort keeping it "User friendly".
You just have to understand the tree structure to navigate around.

<code>if</code> you think that I'm misusing the term geek,
and it should be nerd or dork, then you are one of them.
