Paradigms that make me tick are;

+ Don't create technology but solutions
+ Clear separation of state[less|ful], e.g. through (docker) containers
+ Diagrams or documentation, begin with the end in mind
+ [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code)
+ Security by design


### Security
Your company IT security is important to me,
security is not optional.

Ever company has a different history/legacy and attack surface,
but the most import aspect is the company culture.
Employees should be thanked if they report an incident,
punishment leads to deleting logs/evidence and fear or reporting.

Security is not achieved through special measures alone,
but by creating awareness.
For me this results in creating tools such as a
[password generator](https://lent.ink/projects/pwd),
a docker based
[firewall](https://hub.docker.com/r/svlentink/ipfilter) (not using iptables on host)
and
[2FA backup tool](https://github.com/svlentink/dockerfiles/tree/master/svlentink/totp-backup),
not for the purpose of using it,
but to create awareness and show alternative possibilities
to existing challenges.
