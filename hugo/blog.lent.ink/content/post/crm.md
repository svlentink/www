In our increasingly digital society, choosing the right
['Content Management System' (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)
This article shows an important aspect that may overlook,
since it is very technical; the internal data structure.
Wait, what? This article is not for me!
No it is, intended at everyone who is involved in choosing a platform.


## What do you actually need?

To state it very simple,
you are looking for something that communicates your message
and facilitates in communicating with your costumer.
To make it less abstract, the articles you write,
the content on your website, is data you provide,
in a format the user understands.
The forms on your website, the input the user can give,
is the data you extract and save from the user.


We need a system that communicates our message
in an effective way.
We can all tell if a website is 1y or 7y old,
software/websites communicate differently with us,
we both evolve.


This brings us to our point,
we likely switch our way of communication over time.
To cope with this, we need to upgrade or switch from software platform.

## Switching CRM

When you upgrade to a newer version,
it all goes relatively smooth, which is always a good thing!
Also when you start from scratch, no historical data,
nothing to worry about.
But if you have a bulk data in your current system
and want to switch to a modern system,
you need to migrate your data.


In order to migrate, you need to export the data from your old CRM
and import it into your new one.
If your consultant tries to sell you a solution,
ask him or her how your old data can be imported and how you can export it.
If they are not able to give you a detailed manual,
they probably did not design their system to facilitate it.
This feature is vital when you switch systems,
because this switch you are making now, will happen again in 5-7 years.


## Other things to look for

Besides the ability to easily switch system by exporting and importing,
the way your product is created is important.
If you use SaaS (Software as a Service),
you pay per month instead of buying your software,
which is what you usually do.
The software stays theirs, all security issues, downtime,
maintenance and bugs are their responsibility.
You maybe pay more for the software in the long run,
but you need less people to worry about the infrastructure
and security, which will always result in saving money.
