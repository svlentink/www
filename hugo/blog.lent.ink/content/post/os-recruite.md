# Open source recruitement

A lot of companies need skilled software developers and IT operations.
Which made the demand high and created a whole new market, IT recruitement.

Everyone involved is paying the price.
Developers dislike talking to recruiters,
who often are not on their level of communication (does 42, 1337, 80 and 443 ring a bell?)
and just want to make money.

## Software history

When we look at the software market, we had a similar issue.
Everyone payed top price for basic functionalities,
but did you really receive what you wanted?
Today we have a wide varitity of open source solutions
available to developers,
ranging from libraries to complete solutions (e.g. docker container with a pre-installed ELK stack).

Companies are happy to share their code,
starting with coding conventions to even entire full-stack products.

## Recruitement

Why do we have recruitement?
Because companies want talent and talent wants to have a working environment that suits his or her desires.

So I would like to propose an open source approach to this problem.
Which will make the companies that are good to developers better
and will hurt companies that aren't the right place to be.

## But how?

If a company is convinced that it works with the latest and greatest technologies and tools,
offers a decent salary and has a comfy working environment,
it can be proud to tell that developers would love to work there.
But convincing potential employees (developers) doesn't work with the current recruiters calling/spamming.

If we, as a market, whould change our view of recruitement, we can change it.

## Proposal

Organize an evening in which you open your office space and let developers meet the company,
employees and just have a nice evening with fellow geeks.
But also encourage your own employees to visit other companys a couple of times a year.
This sound scary to managers, but if you have a company to be proud of,
you'll like win more than you lose.

As a developer, I prefer to visit a company which interests me, talk with fellow geeks
and share approaches we make on architecural level (don't worry, company secrets are safe).

I truelly hope we can put an end to the recruitement spam
and start having a beer and pizza with like-minded people.
