In tax topia, a small community,
people pay less taxes.

Usually,
one pays 60% of their income on housing and food,
in tax topia, this is about 15%.
How does this work?

Usually people rent a living space
with a bathroom and a kitchen.
Your boss cannot pay your rent
or provide housing without paying taxes.
However, you could have a room and use the kitchen and toilet at work
and the shower at the gym.
This could reduce the price for a room from 1000EU to 200EU per month,
since we do not need water, just a small room of 4x4m.

But what if you want to accept guests, sit on the couch?
Offices could provide this space after working hours.

In the tax topia concept,
you pay 200EU/m for your room
and your boss pays 500EU/m for your gym membership,
which is located in the same building as your room.
It provides you with toilets, showers and 2 times a day a healthy buffet meal.
In the evening the offices spaces, with couches,
are open to residents.
This allows you to not pay income tax over the 500EU but also no regular tax,
since it's business to business.

The whole building contains housing on one side and office spaces on the other.
In the middle there are showers,
toilets, the gym and the restaurant.
Everything is separate, you can sign up for just the gym membership,
just the office space, just the housing (without food and shower/toilet).
All indoor doors are opened with a electronic key,
which is linked to a person.
If one messes up the toilet,
the person opening that room (toilet) after it should state that in the app,
since his key has last opened the door and he does not want to be fined for it.

Residents can also opt to do cleaning/gardening/restaurant/etc. in the building
for 2 days per week which will count as ~~volunteering~~,
which provides them access to all membership features,
without paying the 500EU,
again preventing income tax and regular tax over this sum.

The building is not called tax topia,
but 'healthy living'

## Startup
A startup,
which needed office space even had more options.
It rented an office space and housed employees
from abroad in the same building,
this allowed the finance guy of the startup to be very creative
with the flexible owner of tax topia ('healthy living')
