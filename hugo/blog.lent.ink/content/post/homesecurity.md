Before you start with DIY home automation,
first ask yourself
"Do I understand the digital security implications of my system",
if your answer is no, consider buying a standard solution,
which handle security for you (e.g. Nest).
Security is very important, you secure your house to thieves
with physical instruments, but when it can be controlled or opened
through digital ways, it is far more dangerous.
Look at it this way,
an ordinary thief has a radius in which he operates (e.g. 30km),
but when you go digital you have far more thieves to worry about.
Secondly, the average household thief isn't as smart and creative
as hackers are, who range from college students to criminals,
who easily work in groups and often do it just for fun.


This brings me to an important aspect;
access logs.
If you have a door that opens with a number combination,
and the guy is standing there for days, trying every combination,
you call the cops.
But if someone is doing this to your system,
you may not notice it,
and when you do, calling the cops won't help,
since most cops function on the level of ordinary thieves.


But don't worry too much,
you are not a valuable target.
People who build their own home automation don't
own a Bentley or a $100.000 Rolex.


## todo notes

consider to block every ingoing port
apply ip filtering to allow only people on the same network
only open ports were you listen on (e.g. webui) and use TLS (SSL)


 e.g. picasa photo upload, sending ip address to server

 ufw, nginx password protected
the random port blocked in firewall router
