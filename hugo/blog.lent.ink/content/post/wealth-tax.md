Smart contracts enable us to do gambling with a fixed set of participants and choose our own risk probabilities.
These participants could be wallets belonging to one and the same person.
This will allow us to store the value inside the smart contract from December to Januari and legally have no value over that time period.

This may seem scam.
If you involve your spouse's wallets,
it is not a single person anymore,
therefore not a scam.
This gambling smart contract can also be done on a larger scale,
allowing anyone to join and choose their own risk percentage.
This would allow you to set it to 0,
resulting in getting your input back after the time has passed.
