We first present the different parts,
before constructing the graphical representation of SAM (Scientific Argumentation Model)
(based on
[sheets 21-23](https://www.os3.nl/_media/2016-2017/colloquia/reading_primary_literature_workshop_20161012.pdf)
).

## Introduction

### Motive
*Why was the research done*

+ "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution."
+ "no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party."

### Objective
*Aim of the research*
```
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
```

## Discussion

### Main Conclusion
*The main outcome of the research*
```
We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.
```

### Implication
*What are the consequences of the research*

### Counterargument
*Statements which weaken the Main conclusion*

+ a. "If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first."
+ b. "If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes"
+ c. "the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions"
+ d. "The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved"
+ e. "linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner."


### Refutation
*Statements which weaken Counterarguments*

+ a. "The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer"
+ b. "it more profitable to play by the rules"
+ c. "download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency."
+ d. "public can see that someone is sending
an amount [..] similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges"

## Results

### Supports
*Data and data interpretations or other literature used by authors to justify their Main conclusion*

+ "The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making."
